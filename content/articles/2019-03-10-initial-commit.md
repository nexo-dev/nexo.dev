So, I want to Welcome everybody who at any circumstances get to this page.

Recently I decided that it will be great at least to save some random things that I found interesting but also try to share it cause I strongly believe that if something become interesting to one person then this person is not alone and there is non zero probability that there is somebody else who can be interested in it. Will see how it goes during the time.

Some technical stuff related to this Blog: main "content generation" software I use for doing this blog posts is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) preconfigured with one of the minimalistic templates called [hugo-classic](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-classic/). It's my first test of Hugo and it looks very good, very simple to use and just start writing some texts. At some point of time I will create own personal theme maybe based on something but currently I don't want to spend time on this.
