Problem:
    You have two slices that potentially share same memory buffer meaning that appending to one can cause changes in another one. So how to understand if two slices are actually share memory?

Let's imagine we have a functions like:

    func IsMemoryShared(a, b []int) bool {
        ...
    }

And we want to preserve following behaviour:

    a := []{1, 2, 3}
    b := []{1, 2, 3}
    
    IsMemoryShared(a, a)  // true
    IsMemoryShared(a[:2]) // true
    IsMemoryShared(a, b)  // false
    IsMemoryShared(a[1:0], b[1:0])  // false

It is known that slice in [Go backed by a struct](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/slice.go#L15) that contain a pointer to some place in memory where slice data is stored and two integers - length and capacity of the slice.

Technically you can access `array` pointer by dereferencing slice value (may not work in future releases if `slice` struct will be changed, for example order of properties will be changed or compiler will decide to reorder struct fields). [Playground](https://play.golang.com/p/mM1j06teCa7)

    a := []int{1, 2, 3}
	fmt.Println((unsafe.Pointer)(&a))  // 0xc00000c030

But just accessing `array` address doesn't solve the problem cause for "sliced" slice you will get different address, check [here](https://play.golang.com/p/YCNzE4qa02P):

    a := []int{1, 2, 3}
	b := a[1:]
	fmt.Println((unsafe.Pointer)(&a))  // 0xc00010a000
	fmt.Println((unsafe.Pointer)(&b))  // 0xc00010a018

There is a nice trick which become possible cause slices in Go are stored as pure arrays in memory which can't be "resized" but actually [got copied](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/slice.go#L285) when slice need to grow. So we can technically check address of the last element in the slice and compare it, [let's try it out](https://play.golang.com/p/rEHQBVzUFVD):

    a := []int{1, 2, 3}
	b := a[1:]
	fmt.Println((unsafe.Pointer)(&a[len(a)-1])) // 0xc0000be010
	fmt.Println((unsafe.Pointer)(&b[len(b)-1])) // 0xc0000be010

But that is not all, in case if slice is cutted from the end [it will not work](https://play.golang.com/p/YL4l6OYw3XK):

	a := []int{1, 2, 3}
	b := a[:1]
	fmt.Println((unsafe.Pointer)(&a[len(a)-1])) // 0xc000016028
	fmt.Println((unsafe.Pointer)(&b[len(b)-1])) // 0xc000016018

Solution is to take address of the last element in the backed array and we know that this array size is defined by a slice capacity, see [here](https://play.golang.com/p/DP-69wkORAC):

	a := []int{1, 2, 3}
	b := a[1:2]
	
	addr := func(v []int) unsafe.Pointer {
      v2 := v[:cap(v)]
	  return (unsafe.Pointer)(&v2[len(v2)-1])
	}
	
	fmt.Println(a, addr(a)) // [1 2 3] 0xc000126008
	fmt.Println(b, addr(b)) // [2] 0xc000126008

So basically algorithm is the following:

1. resize your slice to make `len(a) == cap(a)` (that actually changes only `len` parameter and not result in allocating of new memory)
2. get latest element of the resulting slice
3. compare address of the found element


Even if solution looks solid, unfortunatelly, it is not. In `Go` there is way to change slice capacity down without reallocation:

    a := []int{1, 2, 3}
	b := a[1:2:2] // <- slice operator can have 3 values
	
	addr := func(v []int) unsafe.Pointer {
          v2 := v[:cap(v)]

	  return (unsafe.Pointer)(&v2[len(v2)-1])
	}
	
	fmt.Println(a, addr(a)) // [1 2 3] 0xc0000b8010
	fmt.Println(b, addr(b)) // [2] 0xc0000b8008

Slice operator actually has two forms, one is common - `[start:len]` and second one is quite rare - `[start:len:cap]`. You can't set capacity greater then actual size of the backing memory array but you can definitelly change it down. And for such cases there are no easy way to compare slices, one thing that you can do is to check if slices overlap by cheking if two arrays overlap but it will also not guarantee correct result cause two slices can actually share same memory but not overlap.
