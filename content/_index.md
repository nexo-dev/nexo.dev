# Hi! 

My name is Mikhail Kochegarov, I'm software engineer with a lot of different interests that for some reason I decided to save and hopefully share with anybody who interested. In this blog I will try to cover several completely different things starting from different programming languages aspects, mathematics, some parts of software design and architecture principles that I try to use on my daily basis but also will share things related to my hobbies which include Code Archeology, Game Programming and even maybe something else.
